# Alarm_Clock
### Alarm clock based on android but on PC <br>
Started near 26/7/2022<br>
My first interact with tkinter gui in python.<br>
08/31 Mostly ended with some bugs which will be reapaired later
### For now most important thing are:
  * on/off alarm
  * edit alram
  * choose sounds
  * upload sounds to dir specifed by user
  * a lot of personalization(fe. volume, days alarm, color bg, fg, font size etc)
  * snooze alarms
  * timer and stopwatch with saved times
  
### Things that must be done later:
  * random sounds form list
  * better functions, less repeat
  


## Customization
Change colors, font sizes, font family, images by preference

## Alarms
There you can add your alarms with time, days, description, snooze_time and your own local music(in future maybe will be from youtube(ofc if i can handle this)

## Stopwatch
Justa stopwatch...nothing more but with saved times, descriptions and delays
